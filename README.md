# my-linux-scripts

A collection of scripts that help me to automate tasks I do frequently on my Linux machine.

## Scripts

### up

Works only on Debian-based distributions

Simple bash script that keeps up-to-date the system and removes some unnecessary packages. It performs an update of the APT packages and the snaps packages, which I use many of them. If you still don't know what the snaps are please take a look at [their site](https://snapcraft.io/).
